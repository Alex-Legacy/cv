        <li>JavaScript: JavaScript is the most popular programming language for web development. It's a client-side
            scripting language that enables dynamic behavior on websites, such
            as animations, forms, and other interactive elements.</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the foundation of all
            websites. HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, while
            CSS provides the visual style and layout.</li>
        <li>Python: Python is a high-level programming language that's widely used for web development due to its
            simplicity, versatility, and large developer community. It's used for
            server-side programming and can be integrated with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build complete web
            applications.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These three languages are widely used in the web development industry and are essential for building and
        maintaining dynamic and interactive websites. The popularity of these
        languages may change over time as new technologies emerge, but for now, they remain the most commonly used and
        in-demand languages for web development.</p>
